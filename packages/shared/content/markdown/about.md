![Dominic Fallows](../assets/profile-pic.jpg#float-left-md) Welcome, Iâ€™m Dominic. I have 18+ years experience in
developing and delivering web, mobile and cloud
applications using the latest technologies. I have a
lifelong passion for technology, software
engineering and business.

I enjoy creating tools and experiences that make life
easier for people, teams and businesses. My goal is to
create well designed solutions and well crafted code,
based on industry standards and design patterns.

I'm an advocate for building happy and productive
teams, with a healthy work-life balance, through
better communication, improving processes and
keeping-things-simple, taking an agile approach to
projects.

## Senior Developer

Currently building teams and products based on
TypeScript, JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js,
AWS and Azure. Find out more about my [Projects](/projects).
