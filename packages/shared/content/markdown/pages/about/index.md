![Dominic Fallows](./profile-pic.jpg) Hi, I'm Dominic, a Technical Lead and Senior Developer for web, mobile and cloud apps.

I'm a seasoned developer, leader and life-long enthusiast of technology, software engineering and business. I have been working in technology and business for over 16 years and have a proven track record in using latest technologies to develop and deliver web, mobile and cloud solutions.

## I create tools and experiences for people

I enjoy creating tools and experiences that make life easier for people, by focusing on delivering value to the user and using creative problem solving. I architect, develop and lead the creation of well-designed, efficient code using best software development practices.

## I help build happy and productive teams

I love being part of great teams. Building teams is a joint effort but I do my part to help focus businesses so that we can build, manage and motivate cross-skilled teams. I’ve done this as both a consultant and in-house. I’m an advocate for building happy and productive teams, with a healthy work-life balance, by keeping things simple and taking an agile approach to life and projects.

## What I do

### Technical Lead for web, mobile and cloud teams and products

Aa a Technical Lead for web, mobile and cloud teams and products, my role spans responsibilities across team leadership and management, technical architecture, software engineering manager and technical vision and strategy. 

Ultimately I am responsible for leading software and technical teams, the technical delivery of software products and overall quality of technical deliverables.

I believe it is important for a Technical Lead to also be a senior software engineer, so I make sure that I dedicate part of my time to being ‘hands-on’ to work with developers and write code for products.


## Senior Developer

Currently building teams and products based on
TypeScript, JavaScript, React, React Native, Node.js,
