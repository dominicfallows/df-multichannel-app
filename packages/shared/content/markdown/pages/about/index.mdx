![Dominic Fallows](./profile-pic.jpg)

I have been working in technology and business for over 16 years and have a proven track record in using latest technologies to develop and deliver web, mobile and cloud solutions.

## I create tools and experiences for people

I enjoy creating tools and experiences that make life easier for people, by focusing on delivering value to the user and using creative problem solving. I architect, develop and lead the creation of well-designed, efficient code using best software development practices.

## I help build happy and productive teams

I love being part of great teams. Building teams is a joint effort but I do my part to help focus businesses so that we can build, manage and motivate cross-skilled teams. I've done this as both a consultant and in-house. I'm an advocate for building happy and productive teams, with a healthy work-life balance, by keeping things simple and taking an agile approach to life and projects.

## What I do

Ultimately I am responsible for leading software and technical teams, the technical delivery of software products and overall quality of technical deliverables.

My drive is to create  best-in-class products and great experiences, whether products be user-facing or machine-facing. 

I have always had a passion for the latest technologies and digital products. I keep myself up-to-date with web, mobile and cloud trends and technologies. I love working in fast-paced environments building robust and scalable applications, built to industry standards and best practices.
