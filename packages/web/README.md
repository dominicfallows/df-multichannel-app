# The web app for Dominic Fallows' multichannel app

Bootstrapped from the official [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) starter

## To develop

```sh
cd packages/web/
yarn install
yarn start
```

The site should now start running at `http://localhost:8000`

Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).
